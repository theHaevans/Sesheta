<p>Emma's dad had a horrible temper when she was growing up, and he often took it out on both her and her mom. Her mom taught her how to hide the bruises and make the excuses that waived off relevant authorities. She moved away right after finishing high school to get free, but her mom has stayed with him. With the help of a therapist and good friends, Emma has learned to speak up for herself in both her personal and professional life. She works at an architecture firm. </p>

<h3 id="subgamma">Vicente Malave</h3>
<p>Jack's parents welcomed a seeming friend into their family when he was in the third grade. This friend used their trust to molest Jack for years, convincing his parents that his complaints were due to an overactive imagination. After a suicide attempt, his university sent him to a counselor who saved his life. Jack is now pursuing a masters in social work so he can offer hope to others who feel hopeless.</p>
